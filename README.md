# supporting-data-for-EOS-Northern-Lights
This repository will contain the most up-to-date format for auxiliary data used in stresslog. Since the required format often changes, data for the Northern Lights well will be shown as examples here.

The data here is for example purposes, it is my subjective interpretation of the Northern lights dataset, factual accuracy is not guaranteed (nor even implied). There is no implication of endorsement by Equinor nor any other party.
